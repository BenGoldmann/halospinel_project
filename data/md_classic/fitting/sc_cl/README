This is a quick summary of the throught process for fitting of Sc-Cl potentials. The designation for the different 
setups were decided at stage 3 and applied to previous stages retrospectively.


1,  Intially, the same strategy was used as in a previous study (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D1TA07588H). The input
    and output from this can be found in the folder "stage_1".

    This fitting was run on ScCl3 built using the space group symmetry operators, included shells on Cl with a 
    fixed spring constant. Either shells with a fixed spring constant or no shells at all were used. The starting 
    point was Al-Cl. Other trials at this stage included calculations with other M-Cl potentials as starting point.

    SETUPS 4 and 6.

    RESULTS:
    - Worse fit with no shells (SETUP 6), so no shell setups put aside (for now...)
    - Al-based chosen due to quickest convergence times and similarity of ions

    Sc-Cl: 12131.35 0.2507  0.00 -- used for stages 4 and 5 of project
    Li-Li:   360.53 0.1610  0.00
    Li-Cl:   421.04 0.3340  0.00
    Cl-Cl:  1227.20 0.3210 14.53


2,  The next stage was brought about because of the inconsistency in the conductivities (later turned out to be due to 
    correlated motion and fixed with Haven ratio) and involved more thorough calclaltions. Another factor was that 
    YCl3 could npot be created from spacegroup using symmetry operators in GULP. The input and output from this can be 
    found in the folder "stage_2".

    Structures were now generated from primitive cells as this was shown to influence the lattice matrix and 
    consequently the outcome of the fitting. Another factor found to influence the fitting ws allowing the spring
    constant to also be fitted. Other trials at this stage included calculations with other M-Cl potentials as 
    starting point.

    SETUPS 1 and 2.

    RESULTS:
    - Best fit when k is allowed to be fitted (k increases in all cases - ion more rigid)
    - Al-based was chosen again for the same reasons as before

    Sc-Cl: 2456.22 0.3147  0.00 -- used for stage 6 of project
    Li-Li:  360.53 0.1610  0.00
    Li-Cl:  421.04 0.3340  0.00
    Cl-Cl: 1227.20 0.3210 14.53


3,  The third stage brought about because of the overestimation in the lattice parameters in the LAMMPS calculations.  
    This stage revolved around doing a comparative study of all the different fitting setups (P1 vs space, noshell vs  
    constk vs vark; see chart below). The input and output from this can be found in the folder "stage_3".
    
    During this stage of the fitting, all possible setups were tried then the potential was used in a LAMMPS 
    calculation. This seem to have lead to some differenes in the lattice parameter calculated in LAMMPS. Another 
    small but seemingly significant change was using lattice parameters to every decimal place when the P1 structure   
    is downloaded from Materials Project page (previously only 4 used as read from Materials Project website).

    SETUPS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

    RESULTS:
    - After further assessment, it was decided to stay with P1 structures with every decimal place
    - SETUP 1 broke when tried in LAMMPS
    - SETUP 2 gave great reproduction of ScCl3 in GULP (+<1%), but struggled to reproduce the halospinel in LAMMPS 
      (+4.5%) and altering the Li-Cl potentials caused no further improvements
    - SETUP 3 gave poor reproduction of ScCl3 in GULP (+34%), but performed better in reproducing the halospinel in 
      LAMMPS; furthermore, adjusting the Li-Cl potential (reduce A parameter) can yield the correct parameter

    Li-Cl:   220.00 0.3400  0.00
